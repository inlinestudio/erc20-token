# Base ERC20 token repo
This repository showcases how to implement and deploy a very simple erc20 compatible token to the blockchain. This token does not have any spectacular functionality to it like reflection fees and whatnot but contains a simple, fixed, periodical crowd sale and a very minimal front-end site for it.

This setup was made for [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)(truffle), but it should work with [hardhat](https://hardhat.org) as well.
